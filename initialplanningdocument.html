            <h2>Peer Review</h2>
            <p>
                Joseph Walker peer reviewed my work and this is what he said:
            </p>
            <p>
                It looks great. You did a really good job and making a neat wireframe for all three devices. The only thing I see that could be adjusted would maybe be the location of the current precipitation, wind, and wind direction area as that is conventionally grouped with the other current items such as the current temperature that you have listed towards the top. It's totally optional and up to you though. Looks great and well done!
            </p>

            <h3>My Comments and How I changed my Wireframes</h3>
                <p>
                I really pondered Joseph's comments and took what he said in consideration. I decided to change the location of the current precipitation, wind, and wind direction to put it by the current tempurature. In my wireframes it displays right under the logo of the condition and the current tempurature. It lets the user of the webpage more easily know if the wind would get in the way of a planned or perspective activity.
