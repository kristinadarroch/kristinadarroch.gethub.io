				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>
                The website Amazon (an electronic commerce company) does a great job in providing the customer with a great mobile experience.
                This is shown greatly in the design of the user experience. The website uses great contrast of color of keeping the same tones throughout
                the main webpage, staying to similar colors and tones to display menus and information to find various content on the web site while 
                using brighter colors to display things that might interest the customer. Alignment is seen throughout the web page as you seamlessly
                scroll down the main page.

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
                <p>
                A persona developed for this website is a middle aged woman named Bertha, looking for a cardigan to help keep warm during the 
                fall months. The major needs of this customer would be the quality of the product and some reviews to see how the cardigan
                held up in the weather and after constant use. The users expectations will be high considering the advertisement and 
                    popularity of this website. The user will be looking for an easy and fast shopping experience that yeilds a great deal compared to                           shopping in local stores.
